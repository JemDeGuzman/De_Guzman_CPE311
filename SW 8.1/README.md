Seatwork 8.1 - Aggregating Dataframes

Summary of Learnings:
  The module introduced the concept of ***Aggregation***, which is **the process of combining multiple values
  into a single summary statistic**. With the use of Pandas, we can access functions that make this process 
  simple and easy to perform. Being able to manipulate and perform computations on our data all at the same time
  is very important since it allows us to properly prepare and arrange our data for analysis. These functions
  make it easy for us to analyze and interpret the data that we are observing since we can make precise changes
  to our data. From being able to rearrange how the DataFrame is presented, to being able to carry out computations
  on certain values, Aggregation has proven itself to be an important tool to have as we try to analyze data.
